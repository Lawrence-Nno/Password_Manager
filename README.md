# Password Manager
This project is my personal effort to help us overcome the daily password challenges. The majority of apps and websites require us to create difficult-to-remember passwords. They may also advise against writing them down or using them for other accounts. In some cases, they even go so far as to warn against using personal information like your date of birth. So how are we supposed to remember this complicated password that is supposed to be so unique and not be used for any other accounts? This is why you need a password manager.

This offline tool assists you in creating a very safe password and storing it locally. It also stores the password in the clipboard so that you can easily paste it on the account it is intended for.

### Usage
It is very user friendly and doesn't need much instructions to grasp. Below are the steps to follow:
* Step 1: Fill in the website field with the website or app name you want to create a password for.
* Step 2: Fill in the email or username in its field.
* Step 3: Click on `Generate Password` button. This creates the password, fills the password field automatically and copies it to the clipboard for easy pasting on the website/app.
* Step 4: Click on `Add` button. This asks for a confirmation if you are okay with the details entered and saves the details on a local file after confirmation.
* Step 5: If you have forgotten the password or you want to retrieve the password when you want to log in or for any reason, Just enter the website name e.g. <facebook.com> and click on `Retrieve button`, the password will appear on the password field and also automatically to the `clipboard`
